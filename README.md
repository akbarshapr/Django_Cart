# Product_Catalog

The project was completed using Python and the Django Framework. The default SQLite database was used for storing data, and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap were employed for designing the frontend. The project consists of two pages: a product view and a cart view. Users can explore the product list and add products to their cart by clicking the cart icon displayed alongside the product image. Additionally, users can access the cart by clicking the cart icon in the Navbar.

In the Cart view, users have the ability to increase or decrease the quantity of items, as well as remove items from the cart. Offers provided will be applied as per the specified requirements, and the total amount will be displayed accordingly. I have also added some screenshots of the pages:
